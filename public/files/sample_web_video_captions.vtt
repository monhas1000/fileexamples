WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, and welcome to our sample web video.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a demonstration of the WebVTT caption format,
which is used for HTML5 video captioning.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
WebVTT (Web Video Text Tracks) is designed
specifically for the web and HTML5 video.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Unlike SRT, WebVTT supports styling
and positioning of captions.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For example, you can <c.highlight>highlight text</c>
or <b>make it bold</b> using special tags.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You can also position captions at different
locations on the screen using cue settings.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000 position:10%,line-left align:left
This caption is positioned on the left side.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000 position:90%,line-right align:right
And this one is on the right side.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
WebVTT files start with "WEBVTT" on the first line,
followed by an optional header.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Thank you for viewing this sample WebVTT file!
